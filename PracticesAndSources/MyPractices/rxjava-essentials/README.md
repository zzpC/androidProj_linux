# RxJava Essentials by Ivan Morgillo

This repo is a reference for the topics and the examples in my RxJava Essentials by [Packt Publishing](http://bit.ly/rxjava-essentials).

## Slides ##

The slides provided here are free to use, but I'd like to be mentioned somehow if you use them for your talks.

## App ##

The app is the one used in the book examples. It provides a few basic scenarios for a few common RxJava operators.
